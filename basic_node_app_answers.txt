1. What is a Node module?

A: A Node module is a set of functions to include in our application. We can consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries.

A: We can use either exports or module.exports within our Node app. If we want our module to be a specific object type, we should use module.exports. Otherwise, we should use exports.

3. Why is using exports recommended?
